# SDS-M1-LendingClub
Group members: Michael Thomsen, Mathias Flinta, Emma Munk og Signe Korsgaard.
This is our SDS M1 project where we analyse data from LendingClub to predict 'Good' or 'Bad' loans. 

LendingClub is an online peer to peer platform that match lenders with investors for private and small business loans. This project will analyse data from their platform to predict which lenders who will not be able to pay their full loan in due time defined here as a "bad loan". So this is esssentially a risk analysis.

The project is made in Rstudio locally in a R Markdown file, and then published to PDF and HTLM. We highly recommend to read the whole project in HTLM as the formatting is way nicer here. Just use the Google Colab to run through and see if it works. 

Link to Google Colab:

You only need to run one file to do the whole project called: SDS-Group-project.Rmd (if you want to run locally)
You can read the project just by finding the HTLM file by name: SDS-Group-project.html (recommended for reading!)
Or in PDF: SDS-Group-project.pdf (not recommended for reading!)
