# SDS-M1-LendingClub
This our SDS M1 project where we analyse data from LendingClub to predict good or bad loans. 

They are an online peer to peer platform that match lenders with investors for small private and business loans. This project will analyze data from their platform, to predict which lenders who will not be able to pay their full loan in due time defined here as a "bad loan". So this is esssentially a risk analysis.

The project is made in Rstudio locally in a Rmarkdown file, and then published to PDF and HTLM. We highly recommend to read the whole project in HTLM as the formatting is way nicer here. Just use the google colab to run through and see if it works. 

Link to google colab:

You only need to run one file to do the whole project called: SDS-Group-project.Rmd (if you want to run locally)
You can read the project just by finding the HTLM file by name: SDS-Group-project.html (recommended for reading!)
Or in PDF: SDS-Group-project.pdf (not recommended for reading!)
